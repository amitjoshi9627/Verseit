### How to Run:
1. Install necessary modules with `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` command.
2. Go to __src__ folder (if you want to change paths of files and folders, go to _**src/config.py**_).
3. Run `python3 train.py` to train and save the machine learning model.
4. To run this app from **Streamlit**. Run `streamlit run streamlitapp.py`.
5. Just Enter some text to get some verse generated by the model.

### Data
Data can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/johnhallman/complete-poetryfoundationorg-dataset). I have used the first 25 poem for the training of the model.

> Web App was made using [__Streamlit__](https://www.streamlit.io/)
